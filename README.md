Real-time face mask detection using deep learning and OpenCV
Face Mask Detection with Deep Learning and OpenCV
A real-time face mask detection system using deep learning and computer vision. It detects faces in webcam video and classifies them as "With Mask" or "Without Mask" using a fine-tuned InceptionResNetV2 model. Trained on 12K+ images with strong data augmentation, and tested on real-world photos for robustness. Includes live video prediction, evaluation tools, and visual outputs.
